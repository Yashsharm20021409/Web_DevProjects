            <p class="sectionSubTag small-text">What was the magic behind this success? Hard work? There surely are many
                like him, hard workers, who had in their own way become moderate successes. Luck? Luck comes only to
                those who eminently deserve it.
                As Jawaharlal Nehru once said: “Success often comes to those who dare and act; it seldom comes to the
                timid.” Timid Kalam never was and he deserved success in full measure. What exactly made Kalam what he
                become comes through pages of this short, but remarkable book of reminiscences, a book full of
                delightful anecdotes, each with a lesson to give.

            <p class="sectionSubTag small-text">A year ago, we set out to try something new—an earnest campaign to ask
                our subscribers to help us grow the flock, giving them tools to do so. We set a mathematically and
                philosophically elegant goal: if every Friends Journal subscriber found just one more, together we’d
                double that number to 12,000. We were also open to the possibility that it might not work.
